<h2>For a C</h2>

<p>I don't feel that this design has serious issues.</p>
<p>Good: Handicap accessible, visual feedback, easy to use</p>
<p>Bad: Numbers offset, lots of empty space</p>

<h2>For a B</h2>
<p>Common uses are traversing between floors quickly without thought</p>
<p>Doing so should be simple and quick, with an intuitive way of going from floor to floor</p>
<p>Fixes I would implement:</p>
<p>Overlay the label on the button</p>
<p>include a screen with informati
<p>this should make it easier and quicker to use</p>
<p>the buttons would light up to confirmed they were pressed</p>
<p>Mistakes that might be made are with the screen being thought to be touch</p>

<h2>For an A</h2>
<p>A small screen, approx 3.5x2in.</p>
<p>Buttons light up after being pressed</p>
<p>Tactile buttons for visually impaired</p>
<p>A rating system on the screen based on ease of use</p>

<h2>For extra credit</h2>
<p>It will display information about the floor selected</p>
<p>could show an advertisement until a button is pressed</p>
<p>Tactile buttons for visually impaired</p>
<p>Located low for wheelchair access</p>
